## Overview

Symphony is a `PHP` & `MySQL` based CMS that utilises `XML` and `XSLT` as its core technologies. This repository represents version `2.3.1` and is considered stable.

### HTML Templates

This repository is just plain old HTML files of the Symphony 2.3.1 default workspace and the admin user interface. So, the thought is to open up the idea of the Symphony UI and workflow to be extended to other systems, or to use the HTML templates as the basis for building web interfaces with technologies other than PHP. I'm interested in continuing my experiment to build the Symphony admin with XSLT.

### Symphony Demo

Another possible use for this repository is as a demonstration of the principles and workflow of Symphony CMS and as a teaching aid for people who are learning how to use the system. As plain old HTML, these files can be served to the public and be referred to in documentation.
